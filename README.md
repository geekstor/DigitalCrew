Kaizen AI 🤖

AI agents that discover operational inefficiencies and build custom solutions on-the-fly

Hackathon Project | Built in 4 hours
🎯 Overview
Kaizen AI analyzes company operations through natural language and automatically:

Discovers hidden inefficiencies in workflows
Generates custom AI agents tailored to fix specific problems
Simulates before/after improvements with measurable business impact

Key Innovation: An LLM dynamically builds agents for each discovered problem - no pre-built catalog, every solution is custom-generated.

✨ Features

Natural Language Input: Describe your company in plain text
Automated Analysis: AI identifies optimization opportunities
Dynamic Agent Generation: LLM creates custom agents in real-time
Visual Simulation: Before/after comparison showing agents at work
Impact Metrics: ROI calculations and business value quantification


🏗️ Architecture
Company Description → Problem Analysis → LLM Agent Generation → Simulation → Impact Report
Backend API

POST /analyze - Discovers problems from company description
POST /generate-agents - LLM builds custom agent specifications
POST /simulate - Runs before/after comparison with generated agents

Frontend Flow

Input Page (company description)
Analysis Page (discovered problems)
Generation Page (watch agents being built)
Simulation Page (before/after comparison)
Impact Page (business metrics & ROI)

## 🎬 Demo Flow

**Example Input:**
```
"Tokyo logistics company, 5 trucks, 2 warehouses, 
using Excel for routing, high fuel costs"
System Output:

Problems Found: Route inefficiency ($1.2K/month), Fuel waste ($2.1K/month)
Agents Generated: Custom RouteOptimizer + FuelManager agents
Impact: 47% fuel savings, 3hrs → 15min planning time


🎯 Success Criteria
Must Have:

✅ Problem discovery from text input
✅ LLM generates custom agent specs
✅ Visual agent generation process
✅ Before/after simulation
✅ Business impact metrics

Nice to Have:

Stream generation in real-time
Show generated agent code
Multiple demo scenarios
Export results


🏆 Judging Alignment

Technical: Dynamic LLM-based agent generation vs static templates
Business: Truly custom solutions, scales to any industry
Creative: AI building AI - self-service problem → solution pipeline
Beautiful: Clear visualization of generation process
